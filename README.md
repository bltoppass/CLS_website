4300 Final Website and Paper
So this is what is needed for our website:

Home Page:
This is going to be the bulk of where our CSS3 and Javascript will be
I'm thinking about having a slideshow of different pictures (artistic landscapes and such) with some slogan on top
Some top of page headers that will link to Home Page, About Us, and Contact Us
Same for footer

About Us:
A short paragragh about the company and maybe some pics in various areas (think collage with words in middle)
Some top of page headers that will link to Home Page, About Us, and Contact Us
Same for footer

Contact Us:
This will just have contact info and maybe a fillable form that will send an email to the owner with the words printed on them.
Some top of page headers that will link to Home Page, About Us, and Contact Us
Same for footer

**So if we make a basic layout with a color scheme and link placement, we should be able to use said scheme throughout**
