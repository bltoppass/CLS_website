	  <p>Welcome!  Name's Christopher Felicitas.  I'm a student studying computer science at the University of Houston Downtown.  My current plan is specializing in android development because I heard from expert YouTubers that it's a door opener for careers.  When there's free time from school, I try to do some online android tutorials (Udemy, YouTube) centered around creating small, demonstratable applications that can be finished by one person.  Plan B is to enroll to an online school, such as Udacity, that can help build one's portfolio with applicable projects.  Plan C would be to experiment with Web Programming and create small websites. </p>
	  
	  <p>I've seen some videos online and thought the ideas discussed were quite enlightening, so I'd like to share some:</p>
	  
	  <ol>
		<li><em class = "special">Focus on self-improvement.  </em>It's like pouring water in one empty slot of an ice cube tray (you) and having that water overflow naturally to the other empty slots (what you seek).</li>
		<li><em class = "special">Always have at least one thing you're improving at, doesn't matter what it is.  </em>When things around you aren't ideal, you'll have that one thing to keep you going.</li>
		<li><em class = "special">Generally, accept reality as it is.  </em>Expecting a homeless person to give you money for free or an entire class to get straight 100s on every test/homework will make you live in disappointment every time.  But if situation is within your reach, changing it or changing oneself is an option as well.</li>
		<li><em class = "special">Don't seek external validation from others.  </em>When you try to impress someone, that "cool feeling" of theirs naturally wears out each time they wake up.  When you notice this, you'll want to keep trying to impress them more.  It'll get to a point where you have too much expectations on your shoulders and you'll eventually collapse.  Do onto others the things that you would like done to yourself, because you think it's cool.</li>
		<li><em class = "special">Don't compare yourself to others.  Compare yourself with yourself.  </em>Focus on what you can improve at instead of how awesome the other person is doing.  Otherwise, you'll live under their shadow and it'll be hard to enjoy the things you like.</li>
	  </ol>

		If there's one thing I find interesting in computer science, 
		it's that of OpenAI, an artificial intelligence that beat the number one player 
		in the world of Dota 2 (online PC video game) in 2017 by playing against itself 
		while making minor improvements from each game iteration.  
		No matter what's happening around OpenAI, win or lose, it keeps improving 
		without worrying about its surroundings.  
		This is a mindset I probably might have found out very late in life, 
		but I'm glad I know of it now.  Never thought I'd be learning from a machine.  
		What an era we live in today.
