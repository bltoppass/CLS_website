			<p><tab> My name is Brandon Toppass, I am a focused university senior who is looking to broaden his knowledge of computer science 
		in order to find a concentrated passion that I can build a future on.
		For the last two semesters I have put an extraordinary amount of 
		effort to both raise my GPA and work on bettering my heath. My goals, so far, are on their way to being reached. My GPA is right at a 3.0 with a hope 
		that this semester will raise it even more and I have lost over 60 pounds in the last year. I am going to continue this semester, 
		and hopefully the rest of my days, with this fervor of improving myself in in the way of health and professional means along side the goal of reaching stability and success.
		I am looking forward to learning HTML5, CSS3, and some JavaScript because I like the idea of having the ability to be able to bring life into someone's (or my) 
		webpage with my knowledge of programming and my enthusiasm to design. I get the feeling of being an internet architect, and I think it is going to be something I will enjoy.</p>
